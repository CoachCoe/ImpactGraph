# R1 analytics and event contract

This contract separates verified financial facts from browser observations. Reports must
label sandbox data and must never combine it with live donor acquisition. All timestamps
are UTC; receipt tax years use America/New_York. Amounts are integer USD cents. The launch
cutoff is 1 January 2027 at midnight in America/New_York. Reporting periods are half-open
intervals `[start, end)` and must include their observation cutoff and timezone.

## Durable server facts available now

The audited staff CSV export provides these datasets. Access requires `data.export`.
Use stable record IDs for deduplication, not email addresses, names, or webhook count.

| Logical event | Source / identity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `referral_touch_captured.v1` | referral-touches / touch ID | Most recent accepted referral touch; a later valid link or IRL scan replaces it before the first gift. This is not every page view. Kept for good once it leads to an attributed gift; otherwise deleted 13 months after capture. |
| `checkout_requested.v1` | checkouts / checkout ID | Valid donation request persisted before calling Stripe. Does not prove a hosted page opened or a gift completed. |
| `gift_collected.v1` | gifts / gift ID | Verified recurring collection; checkout completion is insufficient. Carries the referrer and LINK/IRL kind valid at the moment of charge. Historical one-time facts can remain from before R1. |
| `refund_observed.v1` | refund-history / observation ID | Provider or audited staff observation of a refund transition. Count successful current refund state once per refund ID when calculating net dollars. |
| `billing_period_observed.v1` | billing-periods / period ID | Current billing outcome and due date. Current FAILED state alone is not a permanent history of all failures. |
| `billing_attempt_observed.v1` | billing-history / source event ID | Verified FAILED or PAID invoice observation, with amount, billing reason, processor event creation, effective occurrence, and local recording timestamps. A replay of the same event does not add a row. |
| `account_claimed.v1` | donors / donor ID, claimed_at | First account claim, separate from first gift. Giving before claim is normal. |
| `referral_recognized.v1` | referrals / referred donor ID | Direct-only referrer/channel and realized net giving from projections. Check freshness before using totals. |
| `referral_corrected.v1` | referral-corrections / correction ID | Append-only old/new first payment, referrer and channel when late verified facts correct established attribution; includes recording time and rules version. Collection starts with migration 0017 and does not invent past corrections. |
| `recognition_computed.v1` | streaks / donor ID, computed_at | Current and best streak, risk/grace, and permanent founding award. Unknown is not zero. |
| `notification_completed.v1` | messages / message ID | Worker completed the intent; inspect suppression and error fields. Does not prove inbox delivery, opening, or reading. |
| `identity_changed.v1` | identity-events / event ID | Requested, current-address verified, or completed email change. Donor identity remains stable. |

These are event definitions over operational records, not a second event store. Checkout
exports omit visitor hashes, tokens, processor secrets, and payment details. Referral-touch
exports carry `kind` (LINK/IRL) on every row. Email addresses are unnecessary for analytics
joins and must not be copied to an analytics vendor. Deduplicate gifts before joining
refunds or referrals to avoid multiplying collected dollars.

The referral-touches export holds every touch captured in the last 13 months and, before
that, only touches that led to an attributed gift; the others have been deleted.
Attribution on checkouts and gifts is a copy and does not depend on the touch, so
checkouts keep theirs and conversions, referral counts, and referral dollars are
unaffected. Touch counts and touch-based denominators for
capture dates more than 13 months back cannot be recomputed: report them from an export
taken while that period was within retention, and state the capture cutoff.

## Metric definitions

| Metric | Definition and caveats |
|---|---|
| Founding donors | Distinct donor IDs whose first successful gift completed before the launch cutoff. A later refund or cancellation does not remove the permanent badge. Account claim is not required. |
| First-gift conversion by source | Distinct eligible landing journeys with a verified first gift divided by eligible landing journeys, separately DIRECT/LINK/IRL. Attribution uses the frozen source of the earliest verified successful payment, with payment ID breaking timestamp ties; delayed verification can correct the projection. Browser campaign parameters cannot override it. Do not substitute checkout requests for landing journeys. |
| Seven-day share rate | Donors with a confirmed native-share handoff or clipboard copy within seven days of first gift divided by donors whose seven-day observation window has elapsed. Label this a share-action proxy, not verified invitation delivery. Cancellation of a share sheet is not a share. |
| IRL conversion share | IRL first-gift conversions divided by LINK plus IRL first-gift conversions in the same cohort and observation window. Direct gifts are excluded from this denominator. |
| Viral coefficient | Converting direct referrals credited to a donor cohort divided by donors in that cohort, with acquisition dates and observation window stated. No second-level credit. Publish gross first conversions separately from currently qualified referrals after full refunds. |
| Gift volume | Successful recurring gift count and collected dollars. Do not confuse gifts with unique donors; identify any retained pre-R1 one-time facts separately. |
| Streak survival | First-recurring-gift cohorts still current at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days, divided by the cohort old enough to reach each threshold. Grace, late recovery, cancellation, and full refunds follow the domain rules. Current snapshots alone cannot reconstruct historical retention. |
| Involuntary churn/recovery | Scheduled recurring value lost to payment failure after the retry window, with later recovery count/value against that failed-period cohort. Join billing-history to billing-periods and apply the cohort rules below. Voluntary cancellation is separate. |
| Time to first gift | Median elapsed time from an eligible journey's first landing to its verified first collection; report sample size and missing-journey rate. A receipt page view is not collection time. |
| Referral dollars | Actual collected referred gifts less successful refunds, direct-only, with LINK/IRL split. Never promised recurring value or projections of future gifts. |

Self-referral exclusion, last-touch conflicts, refunds, and streak rules are governed by
[the donor domain](donor-domain.md). Retain both gross first-conversion and currently
qualified-referral measures so refund behavior cannot silently rewrite acquisition reports.
Cohort identity is a donor ID, so a verified email change must not create another donor.

## Billing failure and recovery history

The staff report uses first-gift donor cohorts, including donors who never refer anyone,
for the viral denominator. Financial history is evaluated at the report cutoff rather
than using today's net projection. Billing recovery retains its original failure even
after the current invoice becomes paid, and reports recovery within grace separately.
Missing observations or inconsistent amounts make the metric explicitly unavailable.

Streak survival is materialized by the projections worker at 30, 90, 180 and 365 local
calendar days after the first recurring gift. Each checkpoint replays verified financial
facts, refunds and cancellation boundaries at that time. A later lapse cannot erase an
earlier survival result, and restarting does not count as surviving the original run.
Unknown billing history stays unknown. Run the projections worker after upgrading to
rules version 8 to backfill these checkpoints. The report discloses incomplete coverage
until the backfill completes. Landing-to-gift timing remains unavailable without landing
linkage; account creation is never substituted for landing time.

The event worker appends `billing-history` in the same transaction as the validated
period, gift, and projection writes. Invalid facts roll back together. `source_event_id`
references the verified Stripe inbox; the unique constraint makes worker replay safe.
Distinct events remain distinct observations, including repeated failures and duplicate
success notifications. They are not additional lost gifts or additional recoveries.

`occurred_at` is the successful payment's processor timestamp for PAID, and the verified
event creation time for FAILED (the available failure timestamp). `event_created_at`
always retains processor event creation; `recorded_at` is local processing time. Use
occurrence time, not delivery order: a failure delivered after a success stays in the
history without changing the current PAID period. Do not infer exact ordering between
observations with identical occurrence timestamps.

For renewal reporting, select `subscription_cycle`; report `subscription_create` failures
separately from churn of existing donors. Join `period_id` to `billing-periods.id` for
donor identity and the scheduled date. Count each failed period once, using its earliest
failure and first successful payment. The retry deadline is `due_at + 7 days`, matching
the streak rule. At an observation cutoff, an eligible failed renewal with no successful
payment by that deadline becomes lost value once the deadline has passed; later success
is recovered value for that same cohort. Success within grace is recovered before churn.
Never multiply amounts by retry count, webhook count, or the number of joined rows.
Use each period's scheduled amount once for lost value and its verified collection for
recovered value, checking amount consistency before aggregation. Keep voluntary
cancellations separate using their effective dates and the subscription/cancellation
exports; a period skipped intentionally is not an involuntary loss.

Collection begins when the worker version supporting migration `0005_billing_history.sql`
is deployed. The migration does not invent observations for existing period snapshots.
Reports spanning earlier history must flag incomplete coverage; missing history is not
zero failures. Exports require `data.export` and use the existing export audit trail.
No anonymous identifier, browser event, or new third-party destination is introduced.

## First-party browser collection

The web app offers an explicit usage-analytics choice. Collection respects Do Not
Track and Global Privacy Control. Declining or withdrawing consent clears the
session journey identifier and stops subsequent observations. Only the consent
choice persists across browser sessions; a journey UUID lives in session storage.
The first-party endpoint sets a one-day HttpOnly journey cookie for checkout and
verified-account linkage. No third-party analytics destination is used.

The shared PRD §9 taxonomy is accepted at `/analytics/events` for web and native
clients. Web observations include app opens, attribution source, signup, checkout
start, sharing after a completed share handoff/copy, IRL-code display, settings,
reservations, and team actions. Native clients must send the same schema and honor
their own consent choice. Event UUIDs make client retries idempotent. Financial
completion, failure, recovery and lapse events derive from committed server facts;
client claims are never used as financial evidence. `referral_converted` is recorded
once per referred donor, against that donor, when their first gift carries a referrer; a
later attribution correction moves the credit without counting a second conversion.
Badge-earned events are written in the same transaction as awards. The server source is distinct from client sources.

Events contain only allowlisted names/properties, platform, timestamps, optional
internal donor and journey IDs, and deduplication keys. Never send names, emails,
full URLs, referral codes, provider tokens, payment details, or free text. Events
expire after 13 months and donor-linked observations are removed on account deletion.
A usage-observation failure never blocks giving or account access.

Landing-to-first-gift reports join observed journeys to persisted checkout IDs and
verified first gifts. Share-rate cohorts require an observed app open within the
first seven days and a full seven-day observation window; IRL display counts as
showing the code. Both are consented-sample metrics, not a claim about unobserved
visitors. Empty samples remain unavailable with a reason; an observed cohort with
no shares has a measured zero. Server financial exports remain authoritative for
all acquired donors, including donors who decline analytics.
